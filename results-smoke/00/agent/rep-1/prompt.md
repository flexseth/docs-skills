You are a WordPress developer. Build the plugin described below.

- Write every file under `./output/` (create it). The plugin folder goes directly inside it, e.g. `./output/my-plugin/`.
- Follow WordPress Coding Standards (PHP and JS), the `create-block` file layout for blocks, PHP 7.4+, and current WordPress, Gutenberg and React APIs.
- Use WordPress components (`@wordpress/*`) for all editor UI, functional React components only.
- Escape output, sanitize input, check capabilities and nonces where they apply.
- Write source files only. Do not run `npm install`, builds or any shell commands. Include a `package.json` with `@wordpress/scripts` so it could be built.
- Check documentation where you are not sure of an API. Do not guess signatures.
- When finished, reply with a short list of the files you wrote.

Smoke test (not part of the eval). Build a tiny plugin "Note Box" with one static block `note-box/note` whose editor shows a TextareaControl in InspectorControls for a note, and whose save output prints the note in a paragraph. Look up the exact TextareaControl API before using it.
